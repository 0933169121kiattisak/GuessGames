# Let me break down the core concepts of this Word Guess Game to help you understand how it works:
1. Game starts → Random word is selected
2. Player guesses a letter:
   - If correct → Reveal letter in word
   - If wrong → Decrease remaining guesses
3. Game ends when either:
   - All letters are guessed (Win)
   - No guesses remaining (Loss)
